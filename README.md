# Purple in Gold GUI for Ren'py
This GUI is meant to have Visual Novel/Game developers who have little experience with Ren'py.
This repo is public to help and to give the opportunity to help me.

## Instructions to insert GUI in your repo 
I recommend the following ways to include it in your project:
- [**Pull branch**](https://github.com/simone7687/LiveLight#pull-branch) (to **insert** it into your game and **update** it easily)
- **Fork** (to improve the repo or create a GUI based on mine)

### Pull branch
To **insert** or **update** the GUI in your repo with Pull branch I recommend the following procedure:

(only if you want to insert the repo) Create a new empty branch, in the example I'll use **GUI-xxxxp**

`git checkout GUI-3840p`
